# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
The `Outside promise` would print out first followed by the `Inside promise`. This is because `Promise` is asynchronous code. So the `console.log()` will print out while the promise is waiting to resolve.
