You answer is correct. Just want to push the technical communication here:

`.then` *handles* resolved promises, `.catch` *handles* rejected promises. They both take a callback function as an argument.

You Nailed it with the `.then` in your response, but missed it in your `.catch`. Try to stay consistent.
