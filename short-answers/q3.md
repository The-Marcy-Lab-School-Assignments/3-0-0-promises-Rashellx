The answer is a. We return the promise after.

The main idea here is that we want you to understand that when we do the following:

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('yay') //we are only invoking here
})
```

`promise` is going to have a value because the resolve is being invoked. There is no return and we will still get a value.

```js
promise
  .then((val) => console.log(val)) //will log 'yay
```
